# us_de_layout_linux
German ä,ö,ü,ß addd-on for US layout. 

You have a laptop with US keyboard layout and need a way to type the really needed Ää,Öö,Üü,ẞß in German.

Here is the simple solution for Linux.

Download and run setup.sh script as root

Now select "**en(US+DE) RAlt for l3**" from the list of layouts in your keyboard layout selection tool (xfce4-keyboard-settings in XFCE for example)

to type **ä** press ```right alt + a```, to type **Ä** press ```shift + right alt + a```.

For ö do the same with o, ü - u, ß - s. I believe you got the point.

Have fun
